M&amp;S Research Hay Day 2023 Friday 2nd of June 2023 Repository

Welcome to Introduction to Transformers, BERT, and Explainable NLP

Instructors: 

Huyen Nguyen, Daniel Anadria, Hadi Mohammadi

Description: 

In this workshop, we will delve into the world of transformer-based language models,
focusing on the BERT model, which has revolutionized natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al.,
2017; Devlin et al., 2018). We will illustrate the application of these models in sentiment analysis,
demonstrating how the BERT model can assess the emotional tone of the text. Further, we will
introduce SHAP, a game-theoretic approach that elucidates the influence of specific words or phrases on
the predictions made by these models (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). All the required materials, including the
code and detailed project descriptions, will be shared via a GitHub repository.
Preparation: This interactive session will be conducted on Google Colab, requiring nothing more than a
laptop with an internet connection for participation.
